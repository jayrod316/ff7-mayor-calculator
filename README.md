This is my first little project. It is a simple calculator that predicts the Shinra mayor's password in the Shinra Tower in Final Fantasy VII. This is certainly not a necessary tool, as it is very easy to do the math in your head. This project is mostly just to help me understand and learn a few things about how to put a webpage with some JavaScript together. 

The main thing I learned on this project was how to call a JS function by clicking a button or releasing a key.

v1.0
    -type the IGT seconds and click the button to see the answer

v2.0 
    -fixed errors from entering floats and negative numbers 
    -added passwords for the PC version
    -removed button so the user can simply type and see the answer
